# Stations

Edrys Stations are a feature that allows building remote labs, automated
grading, and other experiences that require a non-human teacher at the other
end. A station is simply an Edrys class open in the browser in "station mode"
and left to respond to student queries. This functionality is also handled by
the module loaded on the station end.
